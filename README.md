# ForGAN_TF
TensorFlow-Keras implementation for ForGAN

This is a tensorflow-keras implementation for the Forecasting GAN (ForGAN) which was originally implemented by Koochali et. al (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.12549v1.pdf).

GAN was originally implemented to handle the univariate analysis and prediction, with very few modifications I have tried to do multi-variate analysis as well.

The Data used is the Stock data of GE company available in Kaggle. I have uploaded the the data sample as well.
